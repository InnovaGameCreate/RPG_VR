<strong>RMH Vial 002.</strong><br>
<br>
A simple, customisable vial with liquid, and a cork stopper. There are 3 unique texture variations for a worn look of the vial, and 3 totally clean looks (does not use any textures for the glass, so is fully customisable); there are prefabs for each. The liquid height level is adjustable by scaling the Liquid object along the Z-axis. The liquid inside the vial can have its material entirely changed based on Unity's Standard shader model, all allowing the vial to be modified to achieve different looks. Vial and the cork stopper have separate materials but use the same texture maps. The vial and liquid are made from quads, and the cork is mostly quads (Unity automatically triangulates the mesh, though). Also, please note that transparent materials (the liquid uses the Transparent material setting) can suffer from 'render queue' issues -- from certain angles the material will 'pop'; the prefabs have this issue fixed, but if you change the colour of the liquid you will need to reset the render queue value to 2999 (see the YouTube video / I demonstrate this simple fix towards the end of the video).<br><br>

As always, for a better impression of the asset inside the Unity engine, please view the YouTube video in the screenshots section.<br><br>

<strong>Important Note: </strong>This asset uses Linear Color Space. To set this up in your scene, in Unity go to <strong>Edit >> Project Settings >> Player </strong>, then in the <strong>Other Settings</strong> section of the Inspector in the <strong>Color Space*</strong> drop-down menu, select <strong>Linear</strong>. Using other Color Space settings tends to make colours look washed-out / flat.
